# Two-dimensional-loading-in-vehicle-routing-problem-with-release-and-due-dates
We study a two-dimensional vehicle loading and routing problem, in which customer orders with deadlines become available for dispatch as per their release dates. The objective is to minimise the sum of transportation, inventory, and tardiness costs, while respecting various loading and routing constraints.
