# Two-dimensional-loading-in-vehicle-routing-problem-with-release-and-due-dates
We study a two-dimensional vehicle loading and routing problem, in which customer orders with deadlines become available for dispatch as per their release dates. The objective is to minimise the sum of transportation, inventory, and tardiness costs, while respecting various loading and routing constraints. This scenario allows us to study various trade offs that tend to arise due to temporal order aggregation across release dates. We thereby propose an integrated mathematical formulation to simultaneously model both the routing and loading requirements of the problem at hand. Specifically, as the problem is NP-hard, we propose a scatter search based heuristic approach to solve large-size instances. Additionally, the numerical experiments illustrate the influence of cost structures on
both the optimal loading configurations along with the optimal routes. Importantly, our experiments also suggest that the proposed scatter search method can produce good quality solutions in less time.
This capsule comprise of three solution method, exact formulation, iterated local search and Scatter search with strategic oscillation. all the methods are programmed in c++ platform with CPLEX dependency. IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio has to be installed and use the make file (with paths to cplex libraries ) attached with each method to generate executable. anybody can use the executable to run the datasets
